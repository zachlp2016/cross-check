**Project:** Cross-Check

**Group Member Names:** Zach L, Deonte C, Jon P

**Goals and Expectations for the Project:** _(What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?)_
 Become more advanced and learn more than from previous projects. Learn to collaborate as a team, and make sure we're balanced and assisting each other.

**Team strengths & collaboration styles:** _(consider discussing your Pairin qualities here)_
 - Jon: I like the logic and _how is this gonna work under the hood_ aspect of coding. I also like to make sure that we define how the pieces different people are working on will interact, before separating to work on different parts.
 - Deonte: I work better collaboratively, since I can directly bounce ideas off partners and get/give feedback directly.
 - Zach: I like to use other people's strengths in a team setting for my/our benefit.

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:** We all like to make sure that we're on the same page, and get ourselves organized before getting into the detail work of the project. This will help us to overcome some of issues with group programming where disparate ideas can lead to different approaches that must be merged later.

**Schedule Expectations:** _When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?)_ Mostly open availability except for the below-listed limitations:
 - Deonte unavailable after 2pm on Saturday
 - Zach unavailable after 6pm on Tuesday 2/12
 - Jon possibly unavailable from 4pm to 6pm on Thursday 2/14
No requirement to meet over weekend, but plan to be on campus Monday as if we had normal class schedule.

**Communication Expectations:** _(How often and in what manner will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?)_
 - Don't withhold concerns or differences of opinion on how the team should proceed.
 - Everyone's opinion is valid, and should be discussed.
 - In case of an impasse, majority rules, but if there's any way to merge ideas or compromise, they should be explored.
 - If we have problems with a method or concept (spending more than 30 mins on something and feeling like no progress has been made), reach out to teammates for assistance.
 - Communication in person, on Slack group DMs, Zoom (if video calling deemed necessary), and GitHub comments/reviews.

**Abilities & Growth Expectations:** _(Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement)_
Abilities/strengths
 - Deonte: Quick learner, efficient at explaining and articulating code.
 - Zach: Comfortable overall grasp of Ruby.
 - Jon: Confident breaking apart the logic of an idea, to figure out how to build it back up in code.
Growth Expectations
 - Jon: Get better at finding built-in Ruby methods most suited to what I need to accomplish (spend more time on Ruby Docs).
 - Zach: Become an expert in Hashes.
 - Deonte: Get better at understanding the Ruby Docs, and finding the _right_ method.

**Workload Expectations** _(What features do we each want to work on?)_
 - 2/11: Zach will set up GitHub repo and initial structure. All group members should get set up with Simplecov and Rakefiles. Talk through Iteration 1 and make further decisions from there.

**Workflow Expectations:** _(Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques)_
1. Begin day with group Retro - check in where we're at, and what our next steps are.
2. When assigning tasks, define any interaction patterns (what arguments do these methods take, what do they accomplish, what do they return) before splitting up.
3. Write tests first, then commit them before moving on to writing methods.
   - Commit in small chunks, so that the commit message can clearly describe everything that changed.
4. Commit after completing or refactoring a method.
5. Push to origin and submit Pull Requests upon completing tasks assigned at step 2.
   - Add comments for any code that "just makes it work" and you expect to refactor, so that the Reviewer knows what's going on.
   - Add any comments you deem necessary beyond those.
   - Add both other teammates as Reviewers for each PR.
6. Otherwise, use standard git/GitHub workflow.
   - **never work on Master**
   - modularize work when multiple members are working on the same file).

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:** Be open and up front. If you see a difficulty brewing and don't feel comfortable addressing it one-on-one, arrange a group call or sit-down to get it on the table collectively. This doesn't work if we have hidden frustrations, so even if it's uncomfortable, it's better for everyone to discuss them. Professional feedback needs to be in-person... text is not great at portraying emotion, so it's left up to the reader's interpretation, which is not what we want.

**Project management tools we will use:** Git/GitHub, Slack, Zoom

**Additional Notes:** Nothing at this point.
